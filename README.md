## FAQ

- *Why another graphics engine? Why not just use &lt;my-favourite-engine&gt;?*
  I've taken on this project for the purposes of fun and self-edification. By all means, go with your engine of choice.

- *Can I submit a PR?*
  This is a personal project and I am not accepting PR's for the time being. However, I will likely be open to doing so sometime in the future.

- *Can I request features/provide feedback on your work?*
  Yes. Discussion is always open, although I may not be able to implement every feature requested... or any. I have yet to see where this project will actually go!

- *Can I use some/all of your code to in my own project?*
  You are permitted to use this code under the terms of APGL-3.0 license.

- *Why did you choose the AGPL-3.0 license?*
  I don't know. I tried my best to select the license most appropriate to my interests/goals. But I'm not a software lawyer and I don't have extensive knowledge of software licenses. Discussion is always welcome!
